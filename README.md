Translation Services Sales Analysis Project

Analysis of translation services sales using internal data, prepared in Excel / Power Query.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to uncover key sales patterns in the translation business:
Which languages and service types generate the highest revenue
Whether corporate or individual clients bring more value
Seasonality of demand
Identification of potential areas for optimization

ðŸ§© Data and Preparation

Sales data (Excel sheets) included in the repository:
Zestawienie_biuro_tlumaczen_2024_2025.xlsx
zestawienie_sprzedazy_tlumaczen_2024_2025(AutoRecovered).xlsx

Data cleaning and transformation were performed in Excel using Power Query, including:

Removing duplicates
Standardizing language and service names
Filling missing values
Creating calculated columns (e.g., revenue, margin, etc.)

The data was prepared to be ready for analysis and visualization in BI tools or directly in Excel.

ðŸ“Š Exploration and Analysis Results

The analysis focused on:
Monthly sales trends
Revenue share by language and service type
Profitability by category (e.g., technical, marketing, general)
Comparison of client segments (corporate vs individual)

Key observations based on the available data:

The languages generating the highest revenue are the most popular and in-demand
The corporate segment shows higher stability and contributes more to total revenue
Specialized service types (e.g., technical, business) generate higher margins
Clear seasonality in sales â€“ spring and autumn months show higher demand

ðŸ§° Tools and Methods

Excel / Power Query â€” data transformations, calculations, standardizations, aggregations
Sheets and PivotTables â€” basic analyses and summaries
Excel Visualizations (charts) â€” presentation of key trends and comparisons

âœ… Conclusions and Applications

This project demonstrates how even relatively simple tools (Excel + Power Query) can provide valuable insights for service-based businesses.
The analysis identifies the most profitable areas of translation services, the periods when marketing efforts should be intensified, and which client segments to focus on for business growth.
